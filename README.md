Codes for the enhanced M2MMAC simulation in the NS-3.29. The main programs are atimprogram.cc and comprogram.cc, which simulate the ATIM and COM window, respectively. The shell script (ScriptM2MMAC.sh) is used to run those .cc files and get the simulation output. In the wifi folder, there are the modified codes from the original NS-3.29 wifi model folder. Those modified codes implement the M2MMAC functionalities.
